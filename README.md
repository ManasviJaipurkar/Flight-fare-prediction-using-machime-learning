# Flight-fare-prediction-using-machine-learning-algorithms

The main objective of these project is to predict flight fare prediction using machine learning. This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain.
It can also help customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.

# DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

Step 1:Importing the dataset.
 
Step 2: Data collection and preprocessing.

Step 3: Feature extraction. /encoding

Step 4: Splitting the features and target.

Step 5: Splitting data into training and testing data.

Step 6: Machine Learning Model Training

Step 7: Model Evaluation. 

Step 8: Checking the accuracy of model. 

Step 9: Compare actual and predicted values

For the prediction of the ticket prices perfectly different prediction models are tested for the better prediction accuracy. As the pricing models of the 
company are developed in order to maximize the revenue management. With the help of our project the travelers can find out the right time to buy their tickets at the lowest cost and also can plan accordingly. So to get result with maximum accuracy regression analysis is used. From the studies, the feature that influences the price ticket are to be considered. In future the details about number of available seats can improve the performance of the model
